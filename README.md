# DataStructures Exercise
 This project is an exercise for myself, where I implement various Data Structures from scratch. The specifics of the implementations may not be entirely accurate to the built in language standards as I am implementing them without looking at the "source code". Regardless, I am maintaining the main concepts and strucure behind each Data Structure. I am also utilizing Unit Tests test out my Data Structures.
